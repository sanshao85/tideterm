# Privacy Policy (TideTerm)

TideTerm is an open-source fork of Wave Terminal.

## Default behavior

- TideTerm does **not** send telemetry by default.
- TideTerm does **not** enable automatic updates by default.
- TideTerm’s hosted/cloud endpoints are **empty by default** (no background network calls unless you configure them).

## Optional telemetry

If you enable telemetry in settings and configure an endpoint, TideTerm may send **anonymous usage data** (such as app version, feature usage, and basic system information) to help improve the software. TideTerm does not intentionally collect your file contents, terminal keystrokes, prompts, hostnames, or other personally identifying information.

## AI providers

If you configure TideTerm to use third-party AI providers (for example via BYOK or custom endpoints), your prompts and any data you explicitly send may be transmitted to that provider. Refer to the provider’s privacy policy for details.
