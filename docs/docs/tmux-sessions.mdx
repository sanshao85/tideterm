# tmux Session Manager

When you connect to a remote host with tmux available, TideTerm can show a session manager that helps you reattach or clean up tmux sessions.

## Requirements

- A **remote SSH/WSL connection**
- `tmux` installed on the remote host

If tmux is not installed, TideTerm falls back to a normal shell and the session list will be unavailable.

## Open the Session Manager

- In a remote terminal block, click the **server** icon in the toolbar.
- This opens a list of tmux sessions for that connection.

## What You Can Do

- See all sessions sorted by recent activity.
- Identify the session that belongs to the current block.
- **Attach** to a session.
- **Force Attach** (disconnects other clients from that session).
- **Kill** individual sessions or **Kill All** for the connection.

## Notes

- Force attaching or killing sessions can interrupt other clients. Use with care.
- The list is connection-scoped, so it only shows sessions for the current remote host.
