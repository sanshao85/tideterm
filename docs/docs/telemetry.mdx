## tl;dr

TideTerm ships with **telemetry disabled by default**. If you enable telemetry in settings and configure an endpoint, TideTerm may send anonymous usage data to help improve the software. TideTerm does NOT intentionally collect personal information (PII), keystrokes, file contents, AI prompts, IP addresses, hostnames, or commands. We attach all information to an anonymous, randomly generated _ClientId_ (UUID).

Here's a quick summary of what is collected:

- Basic App/System Info - OS, architecture, app version, update settings
- Usage Metrics - App start/shutdown, active minutes, foreground time, tab/block counts/usage
- Feature Interactions - When you create tabs, run commands, change settings, etc.
- Display Info - Monitor resolution, number of displays
- Connection Events - SSH/WSL connection attempts (but NOT hostnames/IPs)
- AI Usage - Model/provider selection, token counts, request metrics, latency (but NOT prompts or responses)
- Error Reports - Crash/panic events with minimal debugging info, but no stack traces or detailed errors

Telemetry can be disabled at any time in settings.

## How to Disable Telemetry

Telemetry can be enabled or disabled in settings. It can also be disabled using the CLI command `wsh setconfig telemetry:enabled=false`.

:::info

This page was adapted from upstream Wave Terminal documentation. TideTerm differs in that telemetry is disabled by default, and TideTerm's hosted endpoints are empty by default (no background network calls unless configured).

## Diagnostics Ping

TideTerm can send a small, anonymous diagnostics ping after the app has been running for a short time and at most once per day thereafter. This is used to estimate active installs and understand which versions are still in use, so we can make informed decisions about ongoing support and deprecations.

The ping includes only: your TideTerm version, OS/CPU arch, local date (yyyy-mm-dd, no timezone or clock time), your randomly generated anonymous client ID, and whether usage telemetry is enabled or disabled.

It does not include usage data, commands, files, or any telemetry events.

This ping is intentionally separate from telemetry so TideTerm can count active installs. If you'd like to disable it, set the `TIDETERM_NOPING` environment variable.

## Sending Telemetry

Provided that telemetry is enabled and an endpoint is configured, it is sent shortly after TideTerm is first launched and then again periodically. When telemetry is sent, events are marked as sent to prevent duplicate transmissions.

### Sending Once Telemetry is Enabled

As soon as telemetry is enabled, a telemetry update is sent regardless of how long it has been since the last send. This does not reset the usual timer for telemetry sends.

### When TideTerm is Closed

Provided that telemetry is enabled, it will be sent when TideTerm is closed.

## Event Types and Properties

TideTerm collects the event types and properties described in the summary above. As we add features, new events and properties may be added to track their usage.

For the complete, current list of all telemetry events and properties, see the source code: [telemetrydata.go](https://github.com/sanshao85/tideterm/blob/main/pkg/telemetry/telemetrydata/telemetrydata.go)

## GDPR Opt-Out Compliance

When telemetry is disabled, TideTerm may send a single minimal opt-out record (if an endpoint is configured), associated with the anonymous client ID, recording that telemetry was turned off and when it occurred. After that, no telemetry or usage data is sent.

## Deleting Your Data

If you enabled telemetry and pointed TideTerm at an endpoint you control, deletion is handled by that endpoint operator. TideTerm does not run a default public telemetry endpoint.
